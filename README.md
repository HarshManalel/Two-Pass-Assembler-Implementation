# Two-Pass Assembler Implementation

The project addresses the need for a robust two-pass assembler capable of parsing assembly instructions, constructing a symbol table in Pass 1, and generating final object code in Pass 2. Through rigorous testing with various assembly code samples, the assembler's functionality and efficiency are validated, contributing to compiler design principles and system software development.

## Features

- **Pass 1:** Lexical analysis, symbol table construction
- **Pass 2:** Code generation, optimization
- **Error Handling:** Detection and reporting of syntax errors and semantic inconsistencies
- **Deployment:** Implemented on a web platform using Flask for accessibility

## Methodology

The development unfolds through requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and optimization phases, ensuring robustness and efficiency in assembler performance.

## Deployment

Deployed the two-pass assembler project on a website using Flask, enhancing accessibility and usability through a user-friendly web interface.

## Results and Analysis

- **Functionality:** Accurate parsing, symbol table construction, object code generation
- **Performance:** Evaluation of speed, memory usage, and object code accuracy
- **Impact:** Streamlined compilation process, enhanced software development practices

## Conclusion

The project highlights advancements in compiler design and system software development, offering practical insights and solutions for efficient assembly code translation.
